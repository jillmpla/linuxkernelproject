<b>A loadable Linux Kernel Module (LKM) that can read and write between user-space and kernel-space, via /proc.</b>

Focus was placed on understanding /proc, how to communicate between user-space and kernel-space, as well as how to load and unload Kernel modules while the kernel is running.

<b>Overview:</b>

- The proc file system is a virtual file system created when the system boots destroyed at system shut down. It contains information about various processes running and is generally considered the main kernel information source.
